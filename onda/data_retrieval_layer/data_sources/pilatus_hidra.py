Retrieval of Pilatus detector data from HiDRA.

This module contains functions that retrieve data from a Pilatus x-ray detector using
the HiDRA framework. Most functions are shared with the 'pilatus_files' module.

    Opens a Pilatus event retrieved from HiDRA.

    For the Pilatus detector, a HiDRA event corresponds to the full content of a single
    Pilatus CBF data file. This function makes the content of the file available in
    the 'data' attribute of the 'event' object.

    NOTE: This function is designed to be injected as a member function into an
    :class:`~onda.utils.data_event.DataEvent` object.

    Arguments:

        event (:class:`~onda.utils.data_event.DataEvent`): an object storing the event
            data.

    Closes a Pilatus event retrieved from HiDRA.

    The HiDRA event does not need to be closed, so this function actually does nothing.
